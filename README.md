# Stopwatch-
This is my third project on GitHub.
The Stopwatch Project is a simple application designed to measure elapsed time with features like starting, pausing, resetting, and lap recording. 
It is an ideal beginner-level project for learning programming concepts, user interface design, and version control using Git and GitHub. 
This project can be implemented as a console-based or graphical application, depending on the user's skill level and preferences.
